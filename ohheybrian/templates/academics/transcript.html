						Technology and instruction go hand in hand, each informs the other. This course challenged us to
						think through how technology impacts the instructional processes by exploring creative learning
						experiences for students. We layered the TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge)
						framework on top of creativity and purposeful lesson design. This was my first introduction to
						TPACK as an instructional model and it challenged me to consider where my own strengths and
						weaknesses lie as I developed as a teacher.

						On the surface, we explored effective technology leadership. At a deeper level, we
						were challenged to develop our own philosophies of leadership through reading and discourse as a
						group. Insight into the mindset of effective leaders helped me work well in my own contexts
						because I was able to understand and empathize with their goals in the bigger picture as well as
						my role within those organizations. I felt challenged by leadership principles explored from
						outside the perspective
						of public education, but those outside voices provided a variety in thought and execution that
						has helped me work better within my leadership roles.

						This course focused specifically on how technology plays a role in solving difficult problems of
						practice. Throughout the course, we explored different technologies and considered how our
						practice should adapt as those technologies are incorporated. The course culminated in our work
						to solve a "wicked problem of practice" using technology. Having the chance to define and
						explore solutions to difficult problems provided a safe space to share creative ideas which
						might have otherwise gone unidentified.

						As an elective, this course taught us the foundations of computational thinking - a method
						of framing problems, so their solutions can be represented as steps or algorithms. I was
						exploring computer programming as a hobby and this course introduced me to problem-solving
						techniques
						which helped me develop my own skills. As an educator, I learned to break large, abstract
						problems
						into smaller representative pieces, some of which could be solved by creating new systems of
						thinking or
						operating.

						Creativity is a critical skill for teachers and students alike. It is also something which is
						perceived as innate rather than developed. This course had us explore the role of creativity in
						creating teaching materials and assessment of learning as well as methods for how to develop
						creativity in ourselves and our students. As a science teacher by training, I felt challenged
						offer more ways for creative expression of knowledge by my students.

						After moving into an instructional coaching role, my time was devoted to developing and
						nurturing staff through programs of professional learning. Through this course, I had a chance
						to review and apply research-based practice centered on building robust professional development
						opportunities which would lead to change in practice at the classroom level. My final project
						was a micro-credentialing program which could be used in place of traditional professional
						development to track, expose, and elevate teachers who developed skills and competencies through
						professional learning.

						As teachers, it is easy to make decisions based on intuition rather than evidence. This course
						was based on the principles of Action Research, where we identified a potential area of
						improvement and then used data collection and interpretation to make decisions. My action
						research centered on the efficacy of professional development as measured by usage in periods of
						time following the training. Upon completion, I was able to go to district leaders and
						successfully advocate for a change in the way we approached professional learning to drive
						implementation beyond basics and truly affect change in the classroom.

						"Learning" and "schooling" are two discrete processes which are often conflated. This course
						explored the process of learning from cognitive science and social perspectives and asked us to
						consider our own theories of learning and how we rationalize our beliefs with practice. This
						course culminated in a written Theory of Learning based on our own experiences and growth as
						educators. My theory drew connections between the power of positive experiences, the dignity of
						all people, and how classrooms can be a force for equity.

						Teaching nearly always requires some form of online engagement, whether for assignment
						submissions or for the entire interaction for the course. In Teaching and Learning Online, we
						explored various modes of engagement in the online learning space and looked critically at
						systems and structures which will influence our practice in the classroom. While I'm not
						teaching in a virtual space anymore, the principles of considering the medium of instruction
						hold true. I am more equipped to thoughtfully consider the mode of instruction and interaction
						to ensure student success.
