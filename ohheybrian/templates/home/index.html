    <p>I started teaching at an international school in 2009. My principal had enough confidence that a
      newly-graduated biology education major would be able to teach high school chemistry. Since then, I've taught
      <strong>chemistry, physics, biology</strong>, and some <strong>introductory computer science</strong>. I'm a
      teacher at heart but also have experience as an <strong>instructional coach</strong> and district-level team
      leader for <strong>professional development</strong> and <strong>curriculum design</strong>.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not teaching, I'm working on our <a href="https://www.upstreamfarm.com" target="_blank">family's farm in
        Michigan</a>. We raise animals, produce, flowers, and honey bees. We're carving out a well-cared for space and
      teaching our kids the value of hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my other spare time, I like making things on the Internet.
