	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>With all web applications, certain permissions must be granted in order for the app to function. This page
		details the permissions you grant the Endnote Generator AddOn when you install from the Workspace Marketplace.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h2>Permissions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Document (read and write)</strong> - Authorize Endnote Generator to access the current open
			document. This allows the app to look for footnotes and write endnotes to the document body. It does not
			save any information from the document to a third party.</li>
		<li><strong>Sidebars (read and write)</strong> - Create and show a sidebar to run the AddOn in the current
			document. No user information is collected or stored when you allow the AddOn to access the current menus.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All authorizations are handled by Google's OAuth login. There is no data collected or stored as a component of
		using the application.</p>
