<h2>Graduate Goals, 10 Years Later</h2>
<p>I took the long-tail approach to my master's degree - ten years later, this is a look back at my initial goals and a comparison to my professional tracjectory and the learning I've done, formally and informally, along the way.</p>
<h3>The original goals</h3>
<p>I’ve learned a lot about edtech in the last five years and it’s shifted my thinking about how education should look both today and in the future. I’m hoping that “formal” learning on edtech will help me refine and solidify some of my opinions and practices. I’m hoping to be more effective in the classroom with technology as well as teach other teachers on things they can do to improve teaching and learning practices.</p>
<h3>10 years later</h3>
<p>Oh, how optimistic I was. I was confident in thinking I <em>knew</em> what I wanted when I started. After all, I had been teaching for five years in very privileged situations. At the time of writing these goals, I wasn't even in the classroom - I was working in private software, pushing edtech as an instructional solution.</p>
<p>I didn't have enough experience to know <em>what</em> I wanted out of edtech or how it actually should influence instruction, curriculum, and pedagogy as a whole. If I were to re-write these goals, I would do several things differently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't start with presuppositions about what practice "should" look like.</strong> I think I missed a lot of nuance in how practice is interpreted. There isn't a single best practice, but a collection of practices we can use in combinatin to be good teachers and help students find success.</li>
<li><strong>Don't consider technical experience as a qualifier for good teaching.</strong> I started the program after having been usherd along by some edtech "names" along the way. The underlying assumption in this goal was that technology can be a solution to most problems when, in fact, technology can more easily exacerbate existing inequalities rather than alleviate cultural and social stressors on teachers and students. Today, I would be more interested in how our biases are exposed and enacted through our use of technology and then explore how to counteract those biases in targeted ways.</li>
<li><strong>Focusing on technology as a skill to be learned is too narrow.</strong> We can all learn to do new things - I've learned how to use spreadsheets more effectively and how to write my own computer code. Neither of thsoe things really helps me engage with my students. Learning how to use technology more efficiently is not - in and of itself - a good way to engage students in learning. What we need is strong curriculum supported by positive interactions and technology facilitates those experiences between teachers and students.</li>
<h3>My experience now</h3>
<p>My instructional coaching has evolved in the last eight years. Our initial work was to get staff up and running on new platforms and systems, which meant we could go in and teach tech with flourish and style. We got people hyped and exicted to try new things and built skill quickly. Over the last four years, particulalry leading into and through the COVID-19 adjustments, we have learned that skill alone is not enough to change the way teachers and students interact with one another.</p>
<p>What we've seen is a shift to more isolated, independent work. Drill and kill and skill assessment have become the norm over creative, collaborative work. As a coaching leader, I'm helping guide my team - and our teachers - into thinking differently about how we engage and interact with students from the very beginning. Yes, you can post assignments in the LMS, but we've simply swapped one medium for another. How are we encouraging whole-student growth through those assignments? What chances for expression do they have? How are we fostering collaborative, creative work with peers? And ultimately, how do our worldviews of teaching and learning need to change in light of how technology enables us to find anything immediately?</p>
<p>These are the hard questions. Academic research can provide clues, but what we need is clear communicators who can help put the pieces together into funtional methods of instruction which enrich and enable our students to become members of communities of learning along with us.</p>
