	<p>I actively watched for state-level grants which could be used to augment and fund professional learning activities
		within the district. During my time with the instructional coaching team, I have been awarded more than $200,000 to
		provide professional learning incentives for Elkhart Community Schools staff.</p>
	<p>Grants I have personally authored and managed are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Digital Learning Grant (2023) - $47,000:</strong> This grant extended a subscription to accessibility tools for staff and students as well as provide 500 hours of paid training for instructional staff on Universal Design for Learning and accessible materials creation.</li>
		<li><strong>AEP Community Grant (2022) - $10,000:</strong> The American Electric Power Foundation provides grants to be used to celebrate staff and build morale. These funds went towards funding events to recognize staff across the corporation.</li>
		<li><strong>Digital Learning Capacity Building Grant (2020) - $100,000:</strong> As a response to the COVID-19 shutdowns, the Indiana Department of Education created a special grant to be used to pay for staff development and training around digital learning practices. We began a micro-credentialing program to track staff skill development which paired with a self-paced course on developing and using digitial practices in the classroom with students.</li>
		<li><strong>Digital Learning Grant (2017) - $75,000:</strong> Our 1:1 program with iPads used this grant to extend learning opportunities for staff who wanted to build and extend their skills on using the iPad as an instructional device.</li>
